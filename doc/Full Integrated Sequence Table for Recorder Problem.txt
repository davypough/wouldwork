Full Integrated Sequence Table for Recorder Problem (windtunnel)

1. Solve with wouldwork
2. Edit solution inserting (pause) & (resume) to create Playback Phase
3. Create Recording Phase by extracting only agent1* (ghost) actions


A minimum length solution path from start state to goal state:
(1.0 (PICKUP-CONNECTOR AGENT1 CONNECTOR1 AREA1))
(2.0 (PICKUP-CONNECTOR AGENT1* CONNECTOR1* AREA1))
(3.0 (CONNECT-TO-2-TERMINUS AGENT1* CONNECTOR1* REPEATER1 TRANSMITTER1 AREA1))
(4.0 (MOVE AGENT1 AREA1 AREA3))
(5.0 (CONNECT-TO-2-TERMINUS AGENT1 CONNECTOR1 REPEATER1 RECEIVER1 AREA3))
(6.0 (MOVE AGENT1 AREA3 AREA4))
(7.0 (MOVE AGENT1* AREA1 AREA2))
(8.0 (TOGGLE-PLATE AGENT1* PLATE1))
(9.0 (MOVE AGENT1 AREA4 AREA5))


Recording Phase:
     (start-recorder)   ;always begin recording
     (pause)
(2.0 (PICKUP-CONNECTOR AGENT1* CONNECTOR1* AREA1))
(3.0 (CONNECT-TO-2-TERMINUS AGENT1* CONNECTOR1* REPEATER1 TRANSMITTER1 AREA1))
     (pause)
(7.0 (MOVE AGENT1* AREA1 AREA2))
(8.0 (TOGGLE-PLATE AGENT1* PLATE1))
     (pause)
     (stop-recorder)    ;always end recording


Playback Phase:
A minimum length solution path from start state to goal state:  
     (pause)                ;insert pause before any agent1 action
(1.0 (PICKUP-CONNECTOR AGENT1 CONNECTOR1 AREA1))
     (resume)               ;insert resume before any agent1* action
(2.0 (PICKUP-CONNECTOR AGENT1* CONNECTOR1* AREA1))
(3.0 (CONNECT-TO-2-TERMINUS AGENT1* CONNECTOR1* REPEATER1 TRANSMITTER1 AREA1))
     (pause)
(4.0 (MOVE AGENT1 AREA1 AREA3))
(5.0 (CONNECT-TO-2-TERMINUS AGENT1 CONNECTOR1 REPEATER1 RECEIVER1 AREA3))
(6.0 (MOVE AGENT1 AREA3 AREA4))
     (resume)
(7.0 (MOVE AGENT1* AREA1 AREA2))
(8.0 (TOGGLE-PLATE AGENT1* PLATE1))
     (pause)
(9.0 (MOVE AGENT1 AREA4 AREA5))  ;goal
