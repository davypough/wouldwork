;;; Filename: ww-frequencies.lisp

;;; Computes the frequencies of action macro sequences in *solution-paths*.
;;; Eg, (freq 1 2 3) will compute the frequencies of all macro sequences
;;; of length 1, 2, and 3 appearing in the solutions to a problem.
;;; Use on a small problem to develop macros to apply to a larger problem.
